Documentation:1. Layout & Structure
Hero Section: Positioned at the top to capture attention with a clear, inviting title ("Join the Shiplee Franchise") and a primary call-to-action (CTA) button. This section is styled to be bold yet simple, encouraging users to explore more.

Image Slider: Inserted between the hero and the "Why Choose Shiplee" section to showcase various visuals representing Shiplee's services, locations, or network reach. The image slider includes auto-slide functionality, which helps maintain user engagement without manual interaction.

Accordion for Benefits List: The "Why Choose Shiplee" section includes an accordion for a more interactive experience. It saves space while enabling users to expand and collapse a list of Shiplee’s benefits, which makes the content more accessible.

Franchise Benefits Table: This structured table provides franchise-related information concisely, improving scannability and readability.

Partner Logos Grid: A dedicated section for courier partner logos highlights Shiplee’s collaborations. Displayed in a grid format for easy viewing and space efficiency.

2. Design & Styling:
Color Scheme:

Primary Color: #003366 (Deep Blue) - Conveys trust and reliability, which is essential for a franchise opportunity.

Background: Light gray #F8F9FA - Provides a clean and professional look without overwhelming the user.
Text Color: Dark gray #333333 - Ensures readability and a professional tone.
Responsive Design: CSS media queries ensure the page adjusts to various screen sizes, optimizing it for both desktop and mobile viewing. Layouts like grids and tables are made flexible to accommodate different devices, enhancing user experience on mobile.

Typography: Clean, sans-serif fonts are chosen for readability and simplicity. Headers are bold to indicate structure, and body text is sized for easy reading.

3. Interactive & Extra Features
Image Slider
Functionality: Automatically cycles through a set of images with a smooth transition and allows manual navigation using navigation arrows.
Implementation: CSS transitions for smooth effects and JavaScript to control slide changes, including an interval for automatic cycling every 5 seconds.
Purpose: Provides visual engagement and conveys Shiplee’s services and network coverage in an appealing way.
Accordion for "Why Choose Shiplee?"
Functionality: Expands and collapses on click, saving space and making the benefits list accessible as needed.
Implementation: A JavaScript event listener toggles the .open class for accordion visibility.
Purpose: Keeps the page uncluttered while providing users easy access to important information.
Dark Mode Toggle
Functionality: Allows users to switch between light and dark modes. The toggle icon changes based on the mode—displaying a sun icon for light mode and a moon icon for dark mode.
Implementation: JavaScript toggles a dark-mode class on the <body> element and swaps the sun and moon icons based on the mode. Local storage is used to remember the user's preference across sessions.
Purpose: Enhances usability by accommodating users who prefer dark mode, creating a more inclusive design.
Scroll-to-Top Button
Functionality: Appears when the user scrolls down the page, allowing them to quickly return to the top.
Implementation: JavaScript listens for scroll events to display the button after a certain scroll threshold.
Purpose: Improves navigation and user experience, particularly for longer pages.
Lazy Loading for Images
Functionality: Images load only when they enter the viewport, reducing initial page load time.
Implementation: Added the loading="lazy" attribute to <img> tags.
Purpose: Optimizes performance, particularly on mobile devices or slower networks.
Interactive Partner Logos with Hover Effects
Functionality: Partner logos display a subtle scaling or shadow effect on hover.
Implementation: CSS hover effects, such as scale transformation or shadow, applied to .partners-grid img elements.
Purpose: Adds visual interest to partner logos, enhancing the brand's partnership credibility without overpowering the content.


5. Code Organization and Documentation
HTML: Organized with semantic tags for each section (<header>, <section>, <footer>), making it accessible and easy to navigate.
CSS: Structured with clear sections for each element and feature (e.g., image slider, accordion, dark mode toggle) and includes comments for clarity.
JavaScript: Separate functions for each feature (accordion, dark mode, scroll-to-top button) improve readability and maintainability.


6. Future Enhancements
Some potential future enhancements:

Expanded Accordion: Add more expandable sections for additional information, like testimonials or FAQ.
Enhanced Animations: Subtle animations on scroll, such as fade-in or slide-up effects, to make the page more dynamic.
